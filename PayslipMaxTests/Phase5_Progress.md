# Phase 5: Testing Infrastructure Enhancement - Progress Report

## Step 1: Split Large Test Files

We've successfully started splitting large test files into more focused test suites:

### Completed Work:

1. **DiagnosticTests.swift** (289 lines) → Split into:
   - **Models/PayslipItemBasicTests.swift** - Basic model tests
   - **Models/BalanceCalculationTests.swift** - Financial calculation tests
   - **Mocks/MockServiceTests.swift** - Updated with tests for mock service behavior

2. **DocumentAnalysisServiceTests.swift** (491 lines) → Started splitting into:
   - **Services/DocumentCharacteristicsTests.swift** - Tests for document feature detection

### Implemented Standardized Test Data Generation:

1. Created **Helpers/TestDataGenerator.swift** with:
   - Standardized PayslipItem generation methods
   - Edge case test data generation
   - PDF document generation for testing

## Next Steps:

1. Complete splitting DocumentAnalysisServiceTests.swift:
   - Create DocumentStrategiesTests.swift
   - Create DocumentParametersTests.swift

2. Continue implementing domain-specific data generators:
   - Create PayslipTestDataGenerator.swift
   - Create PDFTestDataGenerator.swift
   - Create SecurityTestDataGenerator.swift

3. Begin implementing property-based testing for critical components

## Benefits of Work Completed:

1. Smaller, more focused test files that are easier to maintain
2. Improved test organization by specific domain/functionality
3. More consistent test data with standardized generators
4. Better isolation of test concerns
5. Enhanced readability and maintainability

## Issues/Challenges:

1. Need to verify all tests are properly included in the test plan
2. PDF content generation is platform-specific and may need adjustment for macOS
3. Mock imports may need additional configuration for proper resolution

## Overall Status:

**Phase 5, Step 1: ~40% Complete**

We're making good progress on splitting large test files and implementing standardized test data generation. The next priority is to complete the DocumentAnalysisServiceTests splitting and add property-based testing components.
