# Simple OCR Enhancement Guide

## Assessment of Current State

**Issues Identified:**
- Current `PCDATableParser` (471 lines) uses regex patterns, not spatial intelligence
- No actual table structure detection - just text pattern matching
- Text extraction doesn't use Vision framework for OCR
- Military payslips with tables get "jumbled up" due to poor spatial understanding

**Success Criteria:**
- âœ… Project builds successfully (iOS Simulator)
- âœ… 436 unit tests + 20 UI tests exist
- ðŸŽ¯ Target: Better table parsing for military payslips
- ðŸŽ¯ Target: Maintain all tests passing
- ðŸŽ¯ Target: Keep all files under 300 lines

## Implementation Rules

### File Size Limits
- All new files: **under 300 lines**
- Complex logic: split into multiple files
- Follow existing architecture patterns

### Testing Strategy
- **Build before and after each task**
- **All tests must pass before proceeding**
- Add focused tests for new functionality
- Don't break existing functionality

### Development Approach
- One small change at a time
- Maintain fallback to existing logic
- Use feature flags for new functionality
- Document any breaking changes

---

## Alternative Solutions to Consider

### Open Source Libraries
**Option A: TesseractOCR**
- **Pros:** Mature, customizable, offline
- **Cons:** Large binary size, C++ integration
- **When to use:** If Vision framework insufficient

**Option B: Table extraction libraries**
- **Pros:** Purpose-built for tables
- **Cons:** Additional dependencies
- **When to use:** If custom table detection fails

### Hybrid Approaches
- Combine Vision OCR with traditional PDF text extraction
- Use machine learning for table structure detection
- OCR confidence scoring to choose best extraction method
