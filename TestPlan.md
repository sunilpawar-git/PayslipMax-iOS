# Payslip Max Testing Plan

## Testing Strategy

This document outlines the testing strategy for the Payslip Max application, including the different types of tests, their organization, and best practices.

## Test Types

### 1. Unit Tests (PayslipMaxTests)

Unit tests focus on testing individual components in isolation, using mocks for dependencies.

- **Location**: `PayslipMaxTests/`
- **Target**: `PayslipMaxTests` target in Xcode
- **Framework**: XCTest
- **Purpose**: Verify the behavior of individual classes, structs, and functions

### 2. Standalone Tests (StandaloneTests)

Standalone tests are independent of the main app and don't rely on its dependencies.

- **Location**: `StandaloneTests/` and Swift Package in project root
- **Target**: Standalone Swift executables
- **Framework**: Custom assertions or XCTest
- **Purpose**: Test core business logic without SwiftUI/SwiftData dependencies

### 3. Integration Tests (Future)

Integration tests verify that different components work together correctly.

- **Location**: `PayslipMaxTests/Integration/`
- **Target**: `PayslipMaxTests` target in Xcode
- **Framework**: XCTest
- **Purpose**: Test interactions between multiple components

### 4. UI Tests (Future)

UI tests verify the user interface and user interactions.

- **Location**: `Payslip MaxUITests/`
- **Target**: `Payslip MaxUITests` target in Xcode
- **Framework**: XCTest UI Testing
- **Purpose**: Test the UI and user flows

## Test Organization

### Directory Structure

```
PayslipMaxTests/
├── Models/           # Tests for model classes
├── ViewModels/       # Tests for view models
├── Services/         # Tests for services
├── Mocks/            # Mock implementations for testing
├── Helpers/          # Test helper utilities
└── Integration/      # Integration tests

StandaloneTests/
├── AuthTests/        # Authentication tests
├── PayslipTests/     # Payslip processing tests
└── Utilities/        # Shared test utilities
```

### Naming Conventions

- Test classes: `{ClassUnderTest}Tests`
- Test methods: `test{MethodName}_{Scenario}`
- Mock classes: `Mock{ClassName}`

## Best Practices

1. **Isolation**: Each test should be independent and not rely on the state from other tests.
2. **Mocking**: Use mock implementations for dependencies to isolate the component under test.
3. **Arrange-Act-Assert**: Structure tests with clear setup, action, and verification phases.
4. **Test Coverage**: Aim for high test coverage, especially for critical business logic.
5. **Performance**: Keep tests fast to encourage frequent running.

## Test Data

- Use factory methods to create test data
- Keep test data consistent across tests
- Use meaningful values that represent real-world scenarios

## Continuous Integration

- Run tests on every pull request
- Maintain a test status dashboard
- Enforce test coverage thresholds

## Test Maintenance

- Review and update tests when requirements change
- Refactor tests to improve readability and maintainability
- Delete obsolete tests

## Tools

- XCTest for unit and UI testing
- Swift Package Manager for standalone tests
- Code coverage reporting
- Test profiling for performance analysis
