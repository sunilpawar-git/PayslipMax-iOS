// MARK: - Task Model Extensions and Utilities
// This file contains extensions and utilities for task models
// The core types (TaskIdentifier, TaskCategory, TaskPriority, TaskStatus) are defined in BackgroundTaskCoordinator.swift

// Note: The core model types are intentionally kept in BackgroundTaskCoordinator.swift to avoid circular dependencies
// This approach follows the lessons learned from dependency management during refactoring

// Future enhancement: This file can contain extensions, computed properties, and utility functions for the core types
// For example:
// extension TaskIdentifier {
//     // Additional utility methods
// }
//
// extension TaskCategory {
//     // Category-specific helpers
// }

// This file serves as a placeholder for future model extensions while maintaining clean architecture
