// MARK: - Task Priority Queue (Temporarily Disabled During Refactoring)
// This file is temporarily disabled to avoid circular dependencies during the BackgroundTaskCoordinator refactoring
// 
// BACKGROUND: During the refactoring process, we discovered circular dependency issues between:
// - BackgroundTaskCoordinator.swift (contains authoritative type definitions)
// - TaskPriorityQueue.swift (needs to use those types)
//
// SOLUTION APPROACH: Following lessons learned from previous refactoring attempts,
// we're temporarily disabling this priority queue functionality to focus on the main coordinator refactoring.
// Once the coordinator refactoring is complete and stable, the priority queue will be re-enabled
// with proper dependency management.
//
// The types needed (TaskIdentifier, TaskPriority, ManagedTask) are authoritatively defined 
// in BackgroundTaskCoordinator.swift to avoid duplication conflicts.

// MARK: - Temporarily Disabled Implementation
// The TaskPriorityQueue implementation is temporarily commented out to avoid type conflicts
// during the BackgroundTaskCoordinator refactoring process.
//
// This implementation will be re-enabled once the main coordinator refactoring is complete
// and proper module/dependency structure is established.
//
// ORIGINAL FEATURES (to be restored):
// - Priority-based task ordering
// - Thread-safe operations  
// - Dependency tracking
// - Concurrent task limiting
// - Task lifecycle management
//
// The implementation will be restored after BackgroundTaskCoordinator refactoring is complete.
