// MARK: - Background Task Implementation Extensions
// This file contains the concrete BackgroundTask implementation extracted for better organization
// The core types and protocols are defined in BackgroundTaskCoordinator.swift to avoid circular dependencies

// Note: This file is designed to work with the main BackgroundTaskCoordinator.swift file
// The types used here (TaskIdentifier, TaskStatus, etc.) are defined in the main coordinator file

// This approach was chosen based on lessons learned during dependency management to avoid circular imports

// MARK: - Future BackgroundTask Implementation  
// When proper module structure is established, this file will contain:
// - BackgroundTask<T> class implementation
// - TaskCoordinatorError enum
// - Other concrete task implementations
//
// For now, these remain in BackgroundTaskCoordinator.swift to avoid circular dependencies
// This approach follows the lessons learned from dependency management during refactoring

// This file serves as a placeholder for future concrete task implementations
// The main coordinator file retains all implementation details for now
