// MARK: - Gamification Models
// This file serves as the main entry point for all gamification-related models.
// Individual model types are organized into separate files for better maintainability.
//
// Since all files are part of the same module (PayslipMax), types from QuizModels.swift,
// AchievementModels.swift, ProgressModels.swift, and SessionModels.swift are automatically
// available without explicit imports.
//
// This file maintains backward compatibility while the actual implementations are
// distributed across multiple focused files to comply with the 300-line constraint.
