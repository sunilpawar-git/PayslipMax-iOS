/// Handles the actual pattern matching operations for payslip data extraction.
///
/// This component is responsible for the pattern matching concern extracted from
/// PatternMatchingService as part of the SOLID compliance improvement initiative.
/// It focuses solely on applying patterns to text and extracting structured data.
///
/// ## Single Responsibility
/// The PatternMatcher has one clear responsibility: applying regex patterns to text
/// and extracting structured data from matches. This separation allows pattern
/// matching algorithms to be optimized independently of pattern loading logic.
///
/// ## Pattern Matching Strategies
/// The class implements several matching strategies:
/// - Key-value extraction for general fields
/// - Financial data extraction for earnings/deductions
/// - Tabular structure parsing for complex layouts
/// - Categorization of extracted items
