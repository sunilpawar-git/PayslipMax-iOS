Each tech debt reduction has to be small steps.

At each step, you'll explain me the plan, seek my permission to proceed, then i'll give you permission.

then, you'll implement the update, so as to reduce the tech debt, in small steps.

thereafter, i'll see how xcode is handling the update, see the errors, then we fix the errors, if any, then only we move ahead for implementation of the next step.
