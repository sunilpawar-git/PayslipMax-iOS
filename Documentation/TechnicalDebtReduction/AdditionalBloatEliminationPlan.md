## EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

### If Build Fails:
1. Check the last completed checkbox
2. Review deleted files for missing dependencies  
3. Update DI container registrations
4. Fix import statements
5. Check for debug-only code paths that may be missing
6. Run `xcodebuild clean build`
7. If still failing, revert last change and re-approach

### If Tests Fail:
1. Identify which functionality broke
2. Check if deleted debug/test service was referenced in tests
3. Update test mocks to use proper test directory services
4. Verify that production services work without debug dependencies
5. Fix broken test expectations

### If Debug Functionality Needed:
1. Consider if the functionality is truly needed in production
2. If yes, refactor to proper production implementation
3. If no, implement as DEBUG-only feature
4. Document debug capabilities for future developers
