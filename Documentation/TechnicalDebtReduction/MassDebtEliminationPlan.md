## EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

### If Build Fails:
1. Check the last completed checkbox
2. Review deleted files for missing dependencies
3. Update DI container registrations
4. Fix import statements
5. Run `xcodebuild clean build` 
6. If still failing, revert last change and re-approach

### If Tests Fail:
1. Identify which functionality broke
2. Check if deleted service was still referenced
3. Update test mocks to use remaining services
4. Verify test data generators still work
5. Fix broken test expectations

### If App Crashes:
1. Check crash logs for missing service references
2. Verify DI container has all required services
3. Check for force unwrapped optionals on deleted services
4. Update view models to use remaining services
