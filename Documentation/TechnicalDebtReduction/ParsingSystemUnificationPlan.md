## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES & RISK MITIGATION

- **Rollback**: Keep original async patterns in comments until phase completion

#### **Cache Migration Strategy (Phase 2)**
- **Approach**: Bridge pattern - new unified cache proxies to existing caches initially
- **Data Preservation**: Migrate cache contents using background tasks
- **Performance Safety**: Monitor cache hit rates continuously during migration
- **Fallback**: Ability to revert to original cache systems if performance degrades

#### **Legacy Adapter Elimination (Phase 1)**
- **Verification**: Confirm all `PayslipProcessingPipelineAdapter` usage mapped
- **Migration Path**: Direct DI container updates to use `ModularPayslipProcessingPipeline`
- **Testing**: Ensure parsing results remain identical after adapter removal

### Performance Safety Measures

#### **Baseline Measurement Requirements**
- Parsing time per document type (military, civilian, complex formats)
- Memory usage during peak operations
- Cache hit rates across all 6 existing cache systems
- Concurrent operation throughput

#### **Regression Detection**
