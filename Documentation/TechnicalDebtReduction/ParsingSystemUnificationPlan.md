## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES & RISK MITIGATION

### Critical Implementation Details

#### **Async Migration Strategy (Phase 0)**
- **Priority Files**: Focus on Core/Security and TaskMonitor files first

#### **Cache Migration Strategy (Phase 2)**
- **Approach**: Bridge pattern - new unified cache proxies to existing caches initially
- **Data Preservation**: Migrate cache contents using background tasks
- **Performance Safety**: Monitor cache hit rates continuously during migration
- **Fallback**: Ability to revert to original cache systems if performance degrades

#### **Legacy Adapter Elimination (Phase 1)**

- **Migration Path**: Direct DI container updates to use `ModularPayslipProcessingPipeline`
- **Testing**: Ensure parsing results remain identical after adapter removal

### Performance Safety Measures
