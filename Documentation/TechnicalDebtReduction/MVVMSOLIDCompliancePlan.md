# MVVM-SOLID Compliance Plan (REVISED)
**Strategy: Incremental Architecture Improvement**  
**Target: MVVM + SOLID + Single Source of Truth Excellence**  
**Current Quality: 90+/100 → Target: 95+/100**
**Timeline: 12-15 weeks (Realistic & Safe)**

## 🚨 CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS
- [ ] After each phase: Build project successfully (`xcodebuild build -project PayslipMax.xcodeproj -scheme PayslipMax`)
- [ ] After each phase: Update this file with completion status
- [ ] Check off items as completed
- [ ] Do NOT proceed to next phase until current phase is 100% complete
