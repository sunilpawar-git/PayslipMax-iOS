## üìã Executive Summary

### Current State
- **File:** `PayslipMax/Services/AI/LiteRTService.swift`
- **Size:** 4,506 lines (massive violation of 300-line rule)
- **Complexity:** Monolithic AI service with 38+ public methods
- **Dependencies:** 8+ services depend on this core component
- **Impact:** High - affects entire AI pipeline

### Refactoring Goal
Break down the monolithic `LiteRTService` into **8 focused, single-responsibility components**:

1. **LiteRTServiceCore** (200-250 lines) - Main service coordination
2. **ModelManager** (180-220 lines) - ML model lifecycle management
3. **InferenceEngine** (220-280 lines) - AI inference execution
4. **PerformanceMonitor** (150-200 lines) - Performance tracking
5. **DocumentProcessor** (180-240 lines) - Document processing pipeline
6. **ImageEnhancer** (120-180 lines) - Image preprocessing
7. **ABTestingCoordinator** (140-200 lines) - A/B testing framework
8. **HardwareAccelerator** (100-160 lines) - Metal/CoreML acceleration

### Success Criteria
- ‚úÖ All components under 300 lines
- ‚úÖ Zero breaking changes to public API
- ‚úÖ All tests pass (100% success rate)
- ‚úÖ Performance maintained or improved
- ‚úÖ Clean architecture with proper separation of concerns

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Assessment

### Critical Risks
- **üî¥ AI Pipeline Disruption:** Core AI functionality could break
- **üî¥ Performance Regression:** ML inference could become slower
- **üî¥ Memory Issues:** Model loading/unloading could cause leaks

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Comprehensive Testing:** Unit tests + integration tests + performance benchmarks
- **Gradual Migration:** Keep original service as fallback during transition
- **Feature Flags:** Enable new components incrementally
- **Monitoring:** Performance monitoring throughout refactoring

### Acceptable Risk Level
**Medium Risk** - High reward potential with proper controls in place.
