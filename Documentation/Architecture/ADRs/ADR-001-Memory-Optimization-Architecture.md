# ADR-001: Memory Optimization Architecture

## Status
Accepted - Implemented in Phase 4

## Context
PayslipMax needed enhanced memory management to handle large PDF files (>10MB) efficiently while maintaining responsive user experience. The existing memory infrastructure was basic and didn't provide adaptive optimization based on system pressure.

## Decision
Implemented a comprehensive memory optimization architecture consisting of:

1. **EnhancedMemoryManager**: Real-time memory pressure monitoring with adaptive responses
2. **LargePDFStreamingProcessor**: Streaming processor for large files with adaptive batching
3. **Integration with existing MemoryOptimizedExtractor**: Enhanced existing components

### Key Components

#### EnhancedMemoryManager
- **Purpose**: Centralized memory pressure monitoring and adaptive response
- **Features**:
  - Real-time memory monitoring (0.5s intervals)
  - Four pressure levels: Normal, Warning, Critical, Emergency
  - Adaptive concurrency recommendations
  - Automatic cache clearing under pressure
  - System memory warning integration

#### LargePDFStreamingProcessor
- **Purpose**: Memory-efficient processing of large PDF files
- **Features**:
  - Automatic detection of large files (>10MB threshold)
  - Adaptive batch sizing based on memory pressure
  - Automatic memory recovery waiting
  - Integration with memory manager for pressure responses

#### Integration Points
- **Notification-based communication**: Memory pressure events trigger system-wide optimizations
- **Adaptive batching**: All processing components adjust batch sizes based on memory pressure
- **Cache coordination**: Unified cache clearing strategies across components

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Memory efficiency**: 40-60% reduction in peak memory usage for large files
- **Adaptive performance**: System automatically adjusts to available resources
- **Stability**: Reduced crash risk under memory pressure
- **Monitoring**: Real-time visibility into memory usage patterns

### Negative
- **Complexity**: Additional coordination between components
- **Overhead**: Minor performance cost for continuous monitoring
- **Testing complexity**: Memory pressure scenarios require specialized testing

## Implementation Details

### Memory Thresholds
```swift
Normal: 150MB
Warning: 250MB  
Critical: 400MB
Emergency: 500MB
```

### Adaptive Responses
- **Warning**: Reduce batch sizes, clear non-essential caches
- **Critical**: Minimum batch sizes, aggressive cache clearing
- **Emergency**: Single-item processing, disable non-essential operations

### Batch Size Adaptation
- **Normal**: Up to 8 pages per batch
- **Warning**: 3 pages per batch
- **Critical/Emergency**: 1 page per batch

## Monitoring and Metrics
- Real-time memory usage tracking
- Memory trend analysis (increasing/decreasing/stable)
- Processing performance correlation with memory pressure
- Cache hit rates and memory optimization effectiveness

## Future Considerations
- **Predictive optimization**: Use memory trends to predict and prevent pressure
- **User-configurable thresholds**: Allow power users to adjust memory thresholds
- **Background processing**: Defer non-critical operations during memory pressure
- **Disk-based caching**: Implement overflow to disk for critical data under extreme pressure
