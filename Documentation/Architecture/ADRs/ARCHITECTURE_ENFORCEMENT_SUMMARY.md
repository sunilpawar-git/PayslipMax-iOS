## 📄 Cursor Rules File

### Location: `.cursorrules`
### Key Enforcements:
1. **File Size Constraint**: 300-line limit (non-negotiable)
2. **MVVM Compliance**: Service-View separation enforcement
3. **Async-First Mandate**: No blocking operations allowed
4. **Protocol-Based Design**: Interface-first development
5. **Memory Efficiency**: Large file streaming requirements
6. **Quality Gates**: 10-point validation checklist

### Automatic Triggers:
- File size warnings at 250+ lines
- MVVM violation detection
- Singleton abuse prevention
- Performance optimization reminders

## 🔧 Automated Scripts

### 1. Pre-Commit Enforcement (`Scripts/pre-commit-enforcement.sh`)
**Purpose**: Prevents commits that violate quality standards
**Checks**:
- File size compliance (300-line rule)
- MVVM architecture adherence
- Async-first patterns
- Build integrity
- Singleton usage monitoring

**Exit Codes**:
- `0`: All checks passed, commit allowed
- `1`: Violations detected, commit blocked

### 2. Architecture Guard (`Scripts/architecture-guard.sh`)
**Purpose**: Real-time monitoring and health reporting
**Features**:
- Continuous architecture health monitoring
- Violation detection and reporting
- Memory pattern analysis
- Quality score calculation
- Health trend reporting

**Usage**: `./Scripts/architecture-guard.sh`

### 3. Component Extraction Helper (`Scripts/component-extraction-helper.sh`)
**Purpose**: Guided component extraction for large files
**Modes**:
- `--analyze`: File structure analysis
- `--suggest`: Extraction strategy recommendations
- `--preview`: Extraction plan preview

**Benefits**:
- Maintains backward compatibility
- Suggests appropriate patterns
- Calculates compliance improvements

## 🪝 Git Integration

### Pre-Commit Hook (`.githooks/pre-commit`)
**Activation**: Automatic on every commit attempt
**Process**:
1. Runs comprehensive quality checks
2. Blocks commits with violations
3. Provides specific fix guidance
4. Allows commit only after compliance

**Setup**: Automatically configured with `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`

## 📋 Development Workflow Integration

### Daily Development Pattern:
```bash
# 1. Architecture health check
./Scripts/architecture-guard.sh

# 2. File size verification before editing
wc -l target-file.swift

# 3. Component extraction if needed
./Scripts/component-extraction-helper.sh --analyze target-file.swift

# 4. Pre-commit validation
./Scripts/pre-commit-enforcement.sh
```

### Weekly Quality Assessment:
```bash
# Generate comprehensive report
./Scripts/architecture-guard.sh > weekly_quality_report.txt

# Monitor debt accumulation
./Scripts/debt-monitor.sh

# Verify MVVM compliance
./Scripts/mvvm-compliance-monitor.sh
```
