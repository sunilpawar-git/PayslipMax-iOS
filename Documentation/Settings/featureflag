Perfect! ✅ **The build succeeded!** 

## 🎯 **Feature Flags Now Permanently Available**

The feature flag system is now **permanently enabled** in your app's settings. It will appear in both debug and release builds.

## 📱 **How to Access:**

1. **Open your app** (PayslipMax)
2. **Go to Settings** (gear icon ⚙️)
3. **Scroll to the bottom**
4. Look for **"DEVELOPER TOOLS"** section
5. Tap **"Feature Flags"** 🚩

## 🔧 **What I Changed:**

**File:** `SettingsCoordinator.swift`
- Removed the `#if DEBUG` conditional compilation
- Now `DeveloperSettingsSection()` appears in ALL builds
- Updated comments to reflect permanent availability

## 🚀 **For Production Release:**

When you're ready to remove it for production, simply add back the DEBUG condition:

```swift
// MARK: - 6. Developer Tools (DEBUG only)
#if DEBUG
DeveloperSettingsSection()
#endif
```

## 🎉 **Current Benefits:**

- ✅ **Immediate access** to feature flags during development
- ✅ **Easy testing** of new features without code changes  
- ✅ **Safe deployment** using the Phase 2 rollout infrastructure
- ✅ **User-friendly interface** for toggling experimental features
- ✅ **Persistent settings** that survive app restarts

## 🧪 **Ready to Test:**

Run your app now and you'll see the **Developer Tools** section at the bottom of Settings with access to:
- Feature Flags (toggle experimental features)
- Performance Debug (toggle warning logs)

Your feature flag system is now fully accessible for your Phase 2 dependency injection rollout! 🚀✨
